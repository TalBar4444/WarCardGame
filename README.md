# WarCardGame

WarCardGame is a classic card game app where players go head-to-head against the computer in a battle of luck.

## Features

- **Location-Based Player Selection**: The player's side is chosen based on their geographic location on Earth.
- **Automatic Gameplay**: The game progresses automatically, with cards being drawn and compared until one player wins.
- **Dynamic User Interface**: Combines the power of SwiftUI for modern UI elements with Storyboard for robust navigation and view management.

## Usage

### Location-Based Player Selection
- The app determines the player's side (e.g., which player they represent) based on their geographic location. This adds a unique element to each game.

### Automatic Gameplay
- Once the game begins, cards are drawn automatically, and the game continues until a winner is determined. 

### Winning the Game
- The game ends when the set number of rounds is over, and the winner is declared.

## App Architecture

WarCardGame uses a combination of SwiftUI and Storyboard:

- **SwiftUI**: For creating dynamic and modern UI elements, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Storyboard**: Used for managing the app's navigation and view controllers, ensuring a stable and consistent user flow.
